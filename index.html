        <h3>Funiest Jokes</h3>
        <h4>Snail’s pace</h4>
        <p>A turtle is crossing the road when he’s mugged by two snails.<br> When the police show up, they ask him what happened.<br> The shaken turtle replies, “I don’t know. It all happened so fast.” <br> —Debby Carter</p>



        <h4>Out of sight</h4>
        <p>At a Long Island house party, a chap invited an attractive girl to go fishin            
            with him on the Sound.<br> After an hour without any luck, he asked, “Do you think we ought to try chumming?”<br>

            His companion, a novice at fishing, looked toward the house on the distant shore, then replied, “We might as well.<br> They can’t see us from there.”
            <br>

        <h4>Funny farm</h4>
        <p>A traveling salesman, caught in a torrential rainstorm, stopped overnight at a farmhouse.<br> In the morning, he looked out on a flood coursing through the front yard.<br> He watched pieces of fence, chicken coops, <br>branches, and an old straw hat floating past with the current. Then he saw the straw hat come back, upstream past the house! Then he saw it go down again.<br> Pretty soon it came back upstream—and by now the salesman wondered if he had gone crazy.<br> Finally he called the farmer’s daughter.<br>

            “Oh,” she said, after a glance out the window, “that must be Grandpa.<br> He said yesterday that in spite of hell or high water he was going to mow the yard today.”
